# SafeLink – Real-time Disaster Response Coordination Platform

**Google HackSpace 2025 Submission**  
**Track:** Disaster & Public Safety Systems  
**Status:** Prototype Ready (Live PWA deployable in 48 hours)

### Problem
During disasters, victims and volunteers lose critical time due to lack of real-time coordination.

### Solution
SafeLink is a zero-install PWA that works with just a link. One-tap SOS + live volunteer dashboard = faster rescue.

### Tech Stack
- Glide Apps (No-code PWA)  
- Google Sheets (Real-time DB)  
- Google Maps Platform  
- Firebase (Push notifications)
